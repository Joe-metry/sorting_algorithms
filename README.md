Sorting Algorithm/Implementing with the Big O Notation:
-------------------------------------------------------

Sorting algorithms are algorithms that put elements in a specific order,
such as numerical or alphabetical order. There are many different sorting
algorithms, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some popular
sorting algorithms include bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort,
merge sort, quicksort, and heapsort.

Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the performance
or complexity of an algorithm. It is typically used to estimate the
worst-case scenario, or the upper bound, of the amount of time and/or
space an algorithm requires to complete as the input size grows larger.

In the context of sorting algorithms, the performance of each algorithm
can be described using Big O notation. For example, the best-case scenario
for bubble sort, insertion sort, and selection sort is O(n), where n is the
number of elements to be sorted. However, their worst-case scenario is
O(n^2), meaning the time required to sort the elements grows quadratically
with the number of elements to be sorted.

Merge sort, quicksort, and heapsort are generally more efficient than the
previous three algorithms and have a worst-case scenario of O(n log n),
meaning the time required to sort the elements grows logarithmically with
the number of elements to be sorted.

Understanding the Big O notation of sorting algorithms is important in
selecting the appropriate algorithm for a given problem and input size, as
well as in analyzing the scalability and efficiency of algorithms.
